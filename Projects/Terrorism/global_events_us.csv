This may be a purely criminal act because Kurbegovic's motivations stemmed from personal vendetta's against a judge and commissioners who would not allow him to open up his own business, though he did have some political motivations as well. Kurbegovic claimed this attack by sending an audiotape to a CBS affiliate explaining his alphabet bombing method.  Kurbegovic also claimed responsibility for other attempted bombings, even though police doubt some of his claims.
