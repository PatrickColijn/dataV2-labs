This incident is linked to the firebombing, about a week later,  of a shop in Chicago, owned by an American of Croatian descent (197810040004) as well as the murder of another American of Croatian descent, Krizan Brkic, in California, who has also received a similar threatening letter (197811220002). In June of 1981, eight men were arrested and indicted on charges of racketeering and extortion, including the murders of Cikoja and Brkic, and several arsons.  According to the indictments, the men were members of a Croatian organization called ""Otpor,"" or Croatian National Resistance group that used terror and violence to extort money from individuals of Croatian origin living in the United States. A ninth man was later arrested and indicted as an associate of the other eight responsible for the abovementioned incidents.

Authorities originally arrested Bari and Darryl Cherney, accusing them of illegally transporting bombs.  However, six months later Bari and Cherney were released due to a lack of evidence.  In 2002, their estates were awarded $4.4 million because it was determined that their civil rights were violated by the FBI and the Oakland Police Department.  The pipe bomb in this incident was similar to the explosive device used in the attack on the Louisiana Pacifica Sawmill in Cloverdale California two weeks prior to the attack on Bari (199005100013).  On May 29th, 1990, the Santa Rosa Press Democrat received a letter from an anonymous individual, referring to himself as ""the Lord's Avenger,"" claiming that he bombed Bari's vehicle because of her pro-choice activism.  The Lord's Avenger also claimed to have bombed the Louisiana Pacific sawmill to frame Bari.  It is widely believed that this letter is a hoax.","Will Harper, ""The Unsolved Mysteries of Judi Bari,"" East Bay Express, September 12, 2001.","Katherine Bishop, ""F.B.I.

At the time of the explosion there was a crowd of approximately 60,000 people in the park attending a concert and festivities in celebration of the 1996 Olympic Games. One person was killed as a direct result of the explosion and 111 were injured, including six state troopers and one Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent. A cameraman suffered a heart attack and died while running toward the scene. A call to 911 from a nearby phone booth warned ""There is bomb in Centennial Park. You have 30 minutes."" However, there were delays in communicating this message to authorities in the park, where the bomb was found about five minutes before it exploded. Analysts suspect that the call was intended to lure law enforcement officials to the park to injure them. Authorities initially and erroneously suspected that the person who found the bomb under a bench in the park and warned authorities about it was responsible for planting the device. In 2005, Eric Rudolph was convicted and sentenced to four life terms for carrying out this attack and others, including the bombing of an abortion clinic in January 1997 and the bombing of a gay and lesbian bar in February 1997.",1,1,1,0,,,0,1,0,3,Bombing/Explosion,,,,,14,Private Citizens & Property,78.0,"Procession/Gathering (funeral, wedding, birthday, religious)",Centennial Olympic Park,Concertgoers,217.0,United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Army of God,,,,,,"Rudolph indicated he wanted to force the cancellation of the Olympic Games and ""confound, anger and embarrass"" the federal government for sanctioning abortion.

This is one of eight coordinated attacks occurring at various locations in Mumbai  that killed a total of 171 people and wounded 250 over the course of three days.  In the attack on the Oberoi-Trident hotel complex, two gunmen identified by Police official Maria as Abdul Rehman alias Abdul Rehman Chhota from Multan and Fahadullah alias Abu Fahad from Okara, took over 143 people hostage and killed at least 32 people. Among those killed in the attack were 10 staff members and 22 hotel guests.  Victims reported that a gunman had ushered 30 or 40 people from the restaurant into a stairway and, speaking in Hindi or Urdu, ordered them to put up their hands. Another gunman was reportedly firing indiscriminately around the room. Deccan Mujahedeen, a previously unknown group, claimed responsibility for the attack. The claim has not been confirmed. Officials suspected Pakistanâs Lashkar-e-Tayyaba (LeT) were responsible for the attack, although a spokesman for the LeT denied its involvement.  Ajmal Kasab, an assailant captured on 11/26/2008, told authorities that the attack was a plan devised six months prior that hoped to kill 5,000 people, targeting whites who were preferably Americans or British. According to Kasab, the assailants posed as students during a visit to Mumbai during the previous month to familiarize themselves with the cityâs roads and to film the âstrike locationsâ. Kasab confessed to being a member of Lashkar-e-Tayyaba (LeT), belonging to the LeTâs Fidayeen (suicide squad).  He also identified the masterminds of the attack, who were detained after a raid on an LeT camp on 12/07/2008 and formally indicted on 05/12/2009 for their involvement in the attacks.

This was the first of two similar bombs that detonated approximately 12 seconds and 100 yards apart. The detonation of first device, which was located near Marathon Sports, killed spectator Krystle Campbell. Approximately 264 others were wounded in the two attacks. The alleged assailants of the blasts were later identified as Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, brothers who immigrated to the United States from Russia in 2002 and 2003. On April 19, 2013, as part of an attempt to flee the Boston area, the assailants were involved in a shootout with police that resulted in the death of Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was arrested later that evening after he was discovered hiding in a boat that was parked in a Watertown, Massachusetts resident's backyard. Tsarnaev had written a claim of responsibility on the side of the boat. On July 10, 2013, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty to 30 federal counts related to the attack, including one for the use of a weapon of mass destruction.
